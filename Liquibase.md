# How LiquiBase Works
## Why we need LiquiBase
You need LiquiBase because, in modern software development, databases are just as much a part of your application as your code is. 
You use Git for code version control; Flyway is version control for your database schema.
It works with many databases:
```
MySQL
PostgreSQL
Oracle Database
Microsoft SQL Server
MongoDB (limited support)
```
## What happen without LiquiBase Migration
you revert to old, error-prone manual processes, which are incredibly painful as your team and application scale.
